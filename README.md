# Pokemon Battle


### Short description
This is a simple turn based simulation of a Pokemon battle, in which the player battles vs a cpu. The Pokemon are loaded from .txt file.  
Each Pokemon has the same base hp level (100) and two abilities of varying strength.  
Each turn, the player chooses which of the two abilities he wants his Pokemon to cast, while the CPU chooses theirs at random.  
The first player to decrease their opponents hp to 0 is the winner of the battle.
